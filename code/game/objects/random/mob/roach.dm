	/* All sums are of decimal values. These are the percent weights. 0.22 = 22% spawn chance. Please update this if any changes are made.

	 Hunter = 7/43.54 = 0.16 / 2 variants = 0.8
	 Toxic = 7/43.54 = 0.16 / 2 variants = 0.8      	Both share same weights, hence, split between both, are 0.8% individually.
	 Glowing = 5/43.54 = 0.11 / 2 variants = 0.057
	 Support = 5/43.54 = 0.11 / 2 variants = 0.057  	Both share same weights, hence, split between both, are 0.57% individually.

	 Kaiser = 0.4/43.54 = 0.0091 					Kaiser is intended to be very, very rare, just a little below 1%, chaos level increases spawn chance as well however.
	 Tazntz = 2/43.54 = 0.04
	 Nitro = 1 / 43.54 = 0.02  					Nitro increases with chaos level as well, I do not want these to spawn very often.


	 NOTE:
	 	Some spawn rates have their Chaos_Level divided by 2 in order to ensure that they do not overpopulate/dominate the spawn lists, such as the Fuhrer roach, which is
		intended to primarily be a 'utility' / 'leader' that does not spawn very often once chaos hits level 2, and same for level 4. Higher tiered variants SHOULD
		be more common, but a select few should not dominate the list.
